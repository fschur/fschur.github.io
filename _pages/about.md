I am a PhD student in Statistics at ETH Zurich under the supervision of [Jonas Peters](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/). I work on statistics and machine learning. i am particullary interested in Causality and Reinforcement Learning.

I completed my M.Sc. at ETH Zurich, under the supervision of [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea) and [Peter Buhlmann](https://stat.ethz.ch/~buhlmann/). The topic for my thesis was Lifelong Meta-Learning for Bayesian Optimization and I received the [ETH Medal](https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/education/awards/eth-medal.html).

Before, I worked as a masters student at the [ETH Institute for Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/) under the supervision of Andreas Krause.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
