I am a PhD student in Statistics at ETH Zurich under the supervision of [Jonas Peters](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/). I work on statistics and machine learning. i am particullary interested in Causality and Reinforcement Learning.

I completed my M.Sc. at ETH Zurich, under the supervision of [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea) and [Peter BÃ¼hlmann](https://stat.ethz.ch/~buhlmann/). The topic for my thesis was Lifelong Meta-Learning for Bayesian Optimization and I received the [ETH Medal](https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/education/awards/eth-medal.html).
