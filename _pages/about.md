I am a PhD student in Statistics at ETH Zurich under the supervision of [Jonas Peters](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/). My research interests lie in the intersection of Machine Learning and Statistics. I am particularly focused on Causality and Reinforcement Learning.

I completed my MSc at ETH Zurich, under the supervision of [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea) and [Peter Bühlmann](https://stat.ethz.ch/~buhlmann/). I wrote my master's thesis on the topic of Lifelong Meta-Learning for Bayesian Optimization, which earned me the [ETH Medal](https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/education/awards/eth-medal.html) in recognition of my research.
